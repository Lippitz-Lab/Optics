  These are my lecture notes on optics, in our Physics BSc program. I follow the
  circular structure of Saleh and Teich: Fundamentals of Photonics. We start
  with geometric rays and Gaussian beams, then discuss scalar waves and Fourier
  optics. Materials come together with Maxwell's equations and polarization
  optics. We compare different types of interferometers and coherence as a
  prerequisite for interference. The lecture concludes with a brief look at
  quantum optics.
  
  I want you to be able to really do optics, i.e. not only solve textbook
  problems, but also build setups and do experiments. To this end, the script
  contains practical sections on alignment procedures and experiments.
